# BasicVanillaFlashcardApp

WHAT IS IS

I wrote a Flashcard web app that uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Flashcards are shuffled randomly after the user selects how many flashcards to be quizzed.
The user can pick 5, 10, 25, 50, or all of the available cards. Once the app starts the number of correctly answered cards are tallied for a total score.
I provided 61 Chinese vocabulary words inside a JavaScript array as example data. 

WHAT I LEARNED

- Practice with functional Programming in JavaScript: I applied ES6 techniques of map and filter. I did my best to apply pure functions prior to DOM malipulations. I still have a lot to learn, but I learned why functional programming in JavaSript is time saving and practical.

- The value of having functions being designed to ony perform one simple task for the sake of reusability. 

- The value of immutability. Even when not possible, for example randomizing the order of an array, I made certain to alter copies of the original intead.

- First time using CSS Grid 

- I used ES6 syntax (arrow functions, map, filter, ES6 concatenations, etc) as much as possible to become comfortable with reading and writting it. Appied what I learned from "Learning JavaScript" by Ethan Brown.
